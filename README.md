Perfect — let’s lay out a 30‑day Jetpack Compose learning roadmap so you can go from beginner to confident builder step by step 🚀.

📅 30-Day Jetpack Compose Roadmap
Week 1 – Foundations
- Day 1–2: Install Android Studio (latest Arctic Fox or newer). Create your first Compose project.
- Day 3–4: Learn Composable functions (@Composable) and how they replace XML layouts.
- Day 5–6: Explore basic UI elements: Text, Button, Image.
- Day 7: Practice building a simple “Hello World” app with buttons and text updates.

Week 2 – Layouts & State
- Day 8–9: Learn Row, Column, Box for layout positioning.
- Day 10–11: Understand Modifiers (padding, background, alignment).
- Day 12–13: Dive into State management with remember and mutableStateOf.
- Day 14: Build a Todo list app with add/remove functionality.

Week 3 – Lists, Navigation & Theming
- Day 15–16: Learn LazyColumn/LazyRow for efficient lists.
- Day 17–18: Add Navigation between screens using NavController.
- Day 19–20: Explore Material Design components (TopAppBar, FloatingActionButton).
- Day 21: Create a multi-screen app (e.g., Notes app with list + detail view).

Week 4 – Advanced Features
- Day 22–23: Learn Animations (animateColorAsState, AnimatedVisibility).
- Day 24–25: Explore Themes & Dark Mode with MaterialTheme.
- Day 26–27: Integrate ViewModel + LiveData/Flow for real data handling.
- Day 28: Connect to a simple API (e.g., fetch JSON and display in a list).
- Day 29: Optimize performance (recomposition, previews, testing).
- Day 30: Build a final project — e.g., a Delivery Trip Tracker UI with maps, trip logs, and summary screen.

⚡ Tips Along the Way
- Use Android Studio Preview to see UI changes instantly.
- Test on a real Android device for smoother results.
- Pair learning with Google’s official Jetpack Compose docs and YouTube crash courses.
- Keep projects small and focused — each week should end with a working mini‑app.

👉 By the end of 30 days, you’ll be comfortable with Compose basics, layouts, state, navigation, theming, and animations, and you’ll have built a few small apps plus one larger project.
Would you like me to design that final project idea (Delivery Trip Tracker UI) in Compose so you can see how it ties directly into your delivery workflow?
